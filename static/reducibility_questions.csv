RED_01,Reddit,ELI5,"If a coil stove burner heats up from electricity running through it, why is it that you don't get electrocuted when using a metal pan with a metal handle?",There is an insulating layer around the electric wire that runs through the center of the coil. The pan is not in contact with the voltage source.,
RED_02,Reddit,ELI5,Why is there no warning light for when your headlights or brake lights are no longer functioning?,"Expensive/newer cars will generally tell you if it's out. Older/cheaper cars frequently do not because it's just a lot of electronics. The right way to check a light is every light needs to be wired individually, then power tested (it needs to use a well known amount of power), this requires electronically switching the light onto the power testing circuit. The circuit doing this needs to be able to actually power the light for test, so it can't be just the 1 cent circuits, it's going to be a rather substantial circuit, and it needs to interface with all the switches.",
RED_03,Reddit,ELI5,"If rockets use controlled explosions to propel forward, why can't we use a nuclear reaction to launch/fly our rockets?","From a physics standpoint, we can! There are a couple treaties in the way, though. The Partial Test Ban Treaty says that nuclear weapons can only be tested underground. The Outer Space Treaty says that we can't put WMDs in orbit, on the moon, on any other celestial body, or otherwise in outer space.",
RED_04,Reddit,ELI5,Why are most pencils painted yellow? Why not a different color?,"In the 1800s the best graphite came from China. In China the color yellow is associated with royalty and respect, so by painting the pencils yellow it conveyed that they came from China and had that esteemed nature. Of course a lot has changed since then but the norm of the yellow pencil remains.",
RED_05,Reddit,ELI5,Why is blood not attracted to magnets? It has iron in it.,"Stainless steel has iron in it as well, and it is not magnetic. That's because all forms of iron are not magnetic. Pure iron and certain iron alloys and compounds have free electrons that behave in a special way that makes it magnetic. Iron in stainless steel and hemoglobin does not.",
RED_06,Reddit,ELI5,Why aren't clouds a uniform sheet of vapor in the sky?,"Sometimes cloud cover is connected across the whole sky, other times not. The type of cloud formation depends on variables like the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature - these control things like relative humidity, dew point and wind speed.",
RED_07,Reddit,ELI5,Why do ice cubes crackle when liquid is poured on them?,"So most things expand when heated and retract when cooled. Because ice is already so cold, when you pour a liquid on ice, the surface that the liquid hits will instantly expand, and the rest of the ice doesn't have time to catch up. The top surface expands from heat and the rest of the ice remains cold and doesn't expand. Suddenly, the ice cracks.",
RED_08,Reddit,ELI5,"In extremely cold weather, why is it that we layer 3-4 and sometimes more pieces of clothing for our upper body, but do not do the same for our lower body?",When we get cold our blood focuses on heating our organs and core. The simple answer is that we prioritoze our upper body because that's where all of our vital body parts are.,
RED_09,Reddit,ELI5,Why is it so hard for game developers to scale UI's across multiple screen resolutions?,Because it requires more code and therefore time and money to make a 'good' UI. It's comparatively much simpler to fix everything in place or scale it by a fixed amount for different resolutions.,
RED_10,Reddit,ELI5,Why does the bowl always get hotter than the food in the microwave?,"Because the bowl and the food have a different specific heat. Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of that material. Materials like metal or ceramics have a low specific heat, so it doesn't take much energy to change their temperature. Water, which your food is mostly made of, has a high specific heat, takes a lot of energy to heat it up. So in the case of the food and bowl in the microwave, the same amount of energy is put into both, but it results in a larger change in temperature in the bowl than the food.",
RED_11,Reddit,ELI5,Why do phones sound so much worse when on speaker?,"The energy in a sound signal dies off pretty fast the farther away you get from it. This is fine for really small speakers that you put very close to your ears like headphones, earbuds, and telephone speakers. When you switch to ""speaker"" mode on a phone the speakers used are still very small and the power dies off pretty fast, unfortunately not all the frequencies die off at the same distance so the sound gets distorted.",
RED_12,Reddit,ELI5,"Why do you sometimes wake up and your mouth feels fuzzy with bacteria, but this never happens during the day?","Eating, drinking, talking, and just salivating help wash clean mouth surfaces while awake. One would hope all of these are sharply reduced during sleep.",
RED_13,Reddit,ELI5,Why do some materials become brittle when they get cold and others do not?,Just like how some materials boil faster than others some materials freeze faster than others. Most materials will become brittle at a certain freezing temperature. This has a lot to do with water content. For those things with little to no water content you will have to go to an extremely low temperature to make them freeze enough to become sufficiently brittle that you can break them easily.,
RED_14,Reddit,ELI5,Why does heating stainless steel very hot make it turn different rainbow colors?,"When you heat stainless steel like that, the thickness of the chromium oxide that coats the outside of the steel and makes it stainless changes. The heat grows the layer. The layer reflects light differently based on how thick it is, so you get a rainbow effect.",
RED_15,Reddit,ELI5,Why does pouring soda into a glass create foam when sparkling water doesn't?,Soda is stickier than water. Foam is the fluid sticking to escaping gas. Water slips off bubbles really easily but the soda doesn’t.,
RED_16,Reddit,ELI5,Why do you get all achy when you're sick with the flu?,Inflammation from your immune response. It helps fight the infection but makes you feel pretty awful.,
RED_17,Reddit,ELI5,Why do your eyelids get puffy after crying?,"Tears from strong emotions are less salty than regular tears which keep your eyeball moist. Since your eyelids are ""more salty"" than the tears, the water from your tears goes into your eyelid tissue to balance out the amount of salt, causing the eyelid to swell.",
RED_18,Reddit,ELI5,Why do seizure medications like lamictal work so well for bipolar patients?,A seizure occurs when the brain gets over-excited and there's a whole flurry of activity and chaos - antiepileptics or anticonvulsants or seizure medication work by calming down this overactivity. They act in a similar fashion in bipolar disorder. Different antiepileptics may be used for different aspects or types of bipolar disorders.,
RED_19,Reddit,ELI5,Why do we gasp for air when we're startled or frightened by something?,"Gasping is part of the flight/fight response in which adrenalin and other hormones are released to prepare the body for action. These dilate pupils, speed up heart rate, breathing and metabolic rate, and supply more fuel to the muscles. All these changes mean using oxygen more quickly, so a good deep gasp might be a useful precaution.",
RED_20,Reddit,ELI5,Why does getting a massage feel so pleasurable?,"Because you get to relax while someone else moves your muscles for you. It's sort of like a really good stretch, when your muscles feel warmed up and loose, but someone else is stretching for you, and for an extended period of time.",
RED_21,Reddit,ELI5,Why do countries import oil when they also at the same time export oil?,"Because there are different grades of oil and different refining capabilities. The US, for example, generally has higher grade oil reserves and also has some of the best ability to refine low-grade oil. If they sell expensive high-grade domestic oil, and import cheap low grade oil they can refine, they come out ahead.",
RED_22,Reddit,ELI5,"Why does 6' seem so much taller to us than 5'9"", when the 6' man is less than 5% taller than the 5'9"" man?","Because there’s not a whole lot of variability in height, so even a small amount is noticeable. It may only be a 5% increase in total height, but you move about 30% up the bell curve of adult males.",
RED_23,Reddit,ELI5,Why does car exhaust have such a stronger smell during the winter months?,"Your car has a catalytic converter that, amongst other things, breaks down any unburnt fuel. Unfortunately, for the converter to work it requires a temperature of about 425C (approx 800F). During winter, it is much cooler and more difficult to heat the catalytic converter up to a temperature where it is working efficiently, resulting in a higher amount of unburnt fuel, which is what the smell is.",
RED_24,Reddit,ELI5,Why does stress cause headaches?,"Stress can cause tension in your body, causing muscles to tighten in your neck and shoulders. These tightened muscles can cause headaches.",
RED_25,Reddit,ELI5,Why is having your neck broken so often fatal?,Your spinal cord that connects your brain to body exists in the middle of your neck. Break the neck and you stop breathing because your brain can't tell your diaphram to contract and release and open your lungs to intake air.,
RED_26,Reddit,ELI5,Why is it more pleasant/ichy when someone else lightly touches our body than when we do it ourselves? Shouldn't it be an identical sensation?,"Your brain is wired to respond more to unplanned stimuli. When you touch your own skin, the brain knows where and when it will happen. When someone else does it, your brain can't tell and reacts more strongly.",
RED_27,Reddit,ELI5,Why do we forget bad memories or long periods of trauma?,"This is a process known as ""dissociative amnesia"" — that is, your mind is actively suppressing your recall of these memories in order to avoid experiencing the trauma again. Alternatively, sometimes the memories are never coded into long-term memory at all, due to their nature. This type of trauma usually resurfaces as PTSD once your mind finally writes the trauma into long-term memory. You can't recall memories that aren't in there to begin with.",
RED_28,Reddit,ELI5,"In cartoons, certain clothing patterns such as checkered or plaid, it seems like it's a static pattern that the characters move around on. Why is this?","On a technical level, their shirt is actually transparent, and there is a layer with the picture of the pattern behind the layer the character is drawn on. The character and their shirt moves, but the background layer does not, resulting in what you've described. The reason for doing this is that its a cheaper/faster/easier way to animate clothing with those types of patterns. The alternative is redrawing the whole thing each time the character moves slightly.",
RED_29,Reddit,ELI5,"Why do people twitch, or jump, while they are falling asleep?","It's a called a hypnagogic jerk and they occur during the transition between being awake and asleep. There are a couple of theories for them, such as accidental neuron misfiring, but I like the evolutionary approach to the phenomena. The theory goes that the jerk originates from our origins - when we may have been resting up in trees and hiding from predators. Accidentally falling asleep in these conditions would definitely benefit from this sudden hypnagogic jerk so we could quickly grab a branch to stop us falling out.",
RED_30,Reddit,ELI5,"Why do humans have a habit of staring ""into nothingness""?",You're just processing other information in your mind and not focused on visual inputs at that precise moment.,
RED_31,Reddit,ELI5,"Why is the current in a series circuit with multiple loads constant throughout the circuit? How do the electrons ""know"" to send less current in a circuit with more loads?","The battery doesn't know anything, the amount of current is determined by the load. If I put a 20 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll make it in some certain speed. If I put an 80 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll be going much slower. Same thing happens for the electrons. If you put more resistance in the circuit it is harder for them to squeeze around the circuit. Series devices all share the same current because an electron can't move forward without pushing another out of the way, so you end up with the same number moving into the battery as out of the battery.",
RED_32,Reddit,ELI5,"Why do we scream when we feel pain, is there a physiological reason/benefit?","It is an alarm reaction. When you feel a lot of pain, two things are more likely true, you need help and danger is present. Screaming alerts other tribe members of possible trouble and summons them for aid.",
RED_33,Reddit,ELI5,Why does the water in a glass seem to rise above the edge?,"The 'surface' above water (or any other liquid) is called a meniscus. Water sticks to things, and to itself. When you see water in a cup ""climb"" the edge slightly, that is due to the water 'sticking' to the edge, and bringing more water with it. In many liquids, their sticking together force (cohesion) is stronger than the stick to other things force (adhesion). These liquids do not climb the edges of containers at all. When water gets above the edge of the glass slightly, it's cohesion is still stronger than gravity. When you add too much water, gravity becomes strong than its cohesion, and down the outside of the glass it goes.",
RED_34,Reddit,ELI5,Why are tongue twisters hard for us to say?,"In short it's because certain similar sounds use overlapping parts of the brain to produce, so saying a sequence of those particular sounds confuses the brain. This happens because of the way the brain controls the muscles required for speech.",
RED_35,Reddit,ELI5,Why do we get bags under our eyes when we haven't had enough sleep?,"The skin under your eyes is the thinnest in your body. This is why any amount of fluid shift is very noticeable. For example, when you become dehydrated, your eyes will become sunken. The reason it looks dark is also because of how thin the skin is. The veins under them are very prominent when you are tired because your adrenal glands are being squeezed dry to make cortisol and other sympathetic hormones to try to keep you awake.",
RED_36,Reddit,ELI5,Why do small water droplets on a smartphone touchscreen create a rainbow effect when looked at?,"The water acts like a magnifying glass and zooms into the tiny pixels. Each pixel on a colour LCD display is made up of a red, green and blue sub-pixel. Normally these are so small that you can't see them, though you can if you look closely at a large display live a big TV. Water droplets magnify a few pixels so they become large enough for you to see the coloured sub-pixels individually.",
RED_37,Reddit,ELI5,Why does food turn black when it burns?,"When food gets really hot for a long time the complex carbons in food react and break down enough to leave behind pure carbon, which is black. This will happen with pretty much any food.",
RED_38,Reddit,ELI5,Why is warm tap water murky?,"Calcium carbonate, which contributes to turbidity, is actually the cause behind warm water's murkiness. Its solubility is inversely related to temperature. As temperature rises, aqueous calcium carbonate takes its solid form and forms a white precipitate which causes a decrease in water clarity, hence warm water's murkiness.",
RED_39,Reddit,ELI5,"Why does salt on ice make it colder, but at the same time when you put salt down on snow, it melts it faster?","If you have a block of ice in equilibrium in a glass of water, it will be 0 degrees celsius (32 degrees fahrenheit) until the ice is all melted. If you add salt to this glass of water the melting point will decrease, making it ""colder"" and have an equilibrium at a lower temperature. While the snow melts faster when salt is added to it, this is because the melting (freezing) point is decreased. The temp of the water will be actually be colder, but it will be a liquid. This is also why salt doesn't work when the temperature reaches a certain point.",
RED_40,Reddit,ELI5,"When babies have their teeth, why isn't the gum bleeding when the teeth break through?","They are bleeding, but as it's happening in the mouth, their saliva is picking it up and they're swallowing it as it comes out. The bleeding also isn't very severe, so it may not look like they're bleeding, especially since the gums are already red from swelling. The teeth aren't moving fast enough to create a large enough tear in the gums to cause a whole lot of bleeding.",
